## Reporting a Vulnerability

The CollegiumAI team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: **security@collegiumai.org** (or the lead developer's email)

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: We will provide status updates every 5 business days until resolution
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly
- We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will publicly disclose the vulnerability after a fix is available and deployed

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
CollegiumAI processes sensitive academic and personal information. Key security measures include:

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data should be encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Data Minimization**: Collect and process only necessary information
- **Retention Policies**: Implement appropriate data retention and deletion policies

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use strong authentication mechanisms for administrative access
- Implement proper session management
- Follow principle of least privilege for system access
- Regular review and rotation of access credentials

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Sanitize data before processing or storage
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Use parameterized queries for database operations

### System Security
- Keep all dependencies up to date with security patches
- Regular security scanning of code and dependencies
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use secure configuration management

### AI/ML Specific Security
- **Model Security**: Protect against adversarial attacks on cognitive models
- **Data Poisoning**: Implement safeguards against malicious training data
- **Privacy Preservation**: Use techniques to protect individual privacy in learning
- **Prompt Injection**: Validate and sanitize all input prompts

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Development
- Follow secure coding practices
- Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs

### Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies to latest secure versions
- Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities
- Avoid dependencies with known security issues
- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds

### Configuration
- Use secure defaults for all configuration options
- Implement proper secrets management
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information
- Use environment variables for configuration

### Testing
- Include security testing in your test suite
- Test authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Validate input sanitization and output encoding
- Test error handling and information disclosure

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Assess the scope and impact of the incident
   - Contain the incident to prevent further damage
   - Preserve evidence for investigation

2. **Investigation**
   - Determine root cause of the incident
   - Identify affected systems and data
   - Document timeline and actions taken

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement fixes to address vulnerabilities
   - Restore affected systems and services
   - Verify system integrity and security

4. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users and stakeholders
   - Provide clear guidance on protective actions
   - Document lessons learned and improvements

## Educational Institution Considerations

### FERPA Compliance
- Protect educational records and personally identifiable information
- Implement proper access controls for student data
- Ensure secure handling of academic information
- Maintain audit trails for data access

### GDPR and Privacy Regulations
- Implement data protection by design and by default
- Provide mechanisms for data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure)
- Ensure lawful basis for processing personal data
- Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures

### Campus Network Security
- Consider integration with existing campus security infrastructure
- Implement network segmentation for AI systems
- Use secure communication protocols
- Monitor for unusual network activity

## Security Updates and Patches
