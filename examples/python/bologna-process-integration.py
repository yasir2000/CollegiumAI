Bologna Process Integration Example
==================================

Demonstrates comprehensive integration of the Bologna Process framework
within the CollegiumAI system for European Higher Education Area compliance.

This example shows:
1. ECTS credit management and transfer
2. European Qualifications Framework (EQF) level mapping
3. Student mobility program planning
4. Automatic recognition procedures
5. Quality assurance compliance checking
6. Diploma supplement generation
7. Cross-institutional collaboration

Bologna Process Key Features:
- Three-cycle degree structure (Bachelor/Master/Doctorate)
- ECTS credit system (25-30 hours per credit, 60 credits/year)
- European Qualifications Framework (8 levels)
- Automatic recognition of qualifications
- Quality assurance standards (ESG compliance)
- Student mobility programs (Erasmus+, CEEPUS, etc.)
