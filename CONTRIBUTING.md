### Cognitive Architecture Principles
- Maintain consistency with cognitive science foundations
- Ensure modular design for cognitive components
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Consider performance implications of cognitive processing

### Testing Requirements
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass
- Aim for at least 75% test coverage
- Include both unit and integration tests

### Documentation Standards
- Update relevant documentation for changes
- Include code examples in documentation
- Maintain consistent formatting and style
- Consider different audience levels (users, developers, researchers)

## üß† Cognitive Architecture Contribution Guide

### Adding New Cognitive Modules
```python
# Example: Adding a new cognitive capability
class EmotionalIntelligence:
    """New cognitive module for emotional processing"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.emotional_state = {}
        self.empathy_model = EmpathyModel()
    
    async def process_emotional_context(self, input_data):
        """Process emotional cues from input"""
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

### Extending Persona Types
```python
# Example: Adding a new persona type
class PersonaType(Enum):
    # Existing personas...
    INTERNATIONAL_RESEARCHER = "international_researcher"
    
def create_international_researcher_profile():
    """Create cognitive profile for international researcher"""
    return {
        "cultural_awareness": 0.9,
        "research_focus": 0.95,
        "language_adaptation": 0.8,
        # Additional parameters...
    }
```

### Improving Multi-Agent Coordination
```python
# Example: Adding new coordination strategy
class CollaborativeStrategy:
    """Enhanced coordination for complex academic tasks"""
    
    async def coordinate_research_project(self, agents, project_data):
        """Coordinate agents for research project support"""
        # Implementation here
        pass
```
