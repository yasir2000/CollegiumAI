CollegiumAI ReACT Multi-Agent Collaborative Framework Demo
=========================================================

This demonstrates the ReACT (Reasoning, Acting, Observing) framework where
multiple AI agents collaborate intelligently using LLMs to make complex decisions,
create sophisticated plans, and execute coordinated actions.

ReACT Framework:
- REASONING: Agents think through problems using LLM-powered analysis
- ACTING: Agents take concrete actions based on their reasoning
- OBSERVING/COLLABORATING: Agents observe results and collaborate with other agents
